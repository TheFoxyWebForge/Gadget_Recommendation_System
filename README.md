## Overview
The AI-Based Personalized Gadget Recommendation System is a major project that aims to develop an intelligent system for recommending personalized gadgets to users based on their preferences and needs. This system leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and techniques to provide accurate and tailored recommendations, enhancing the user's shopping experience.

## Features

+ **Personalized Recommendations:** The system analyzes user preferences, behavior, and historical data to generate personalized gadget recommendations that align with the user's needs and interests.
+ **Intelligent Filtering:** Advanced filtering techniques are applied to refine the recommendations based on various factors such as price range, brand preference, and specific gadget features.
+ **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The recommendation engine utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to learn from user interactions and continuously improve the accuracy of its recommendations.
+ **Interactive User Interface:** A user-friendly and intuitive interface allows users to easily browse and explore recommended gadgets, providing a seamless shopping experience.


## Technologies Used

+ **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the recommendation system and implementing AI algorithms.
+ **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library that offers various algorithms and utilities for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
+ **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the user interface and handle HTTP requests and responses.
+ **HTML/CSS:** Front-end technologies used for creating an attractive and responsive user interface.
